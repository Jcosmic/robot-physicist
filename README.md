# robot-physicist
The "Robot Physicist" is an automated, reproducible physics analysis pipeline for the "Físico Remoto" challenge. It analyzes open ATLAS data using Python tools (uproot, awkward, hist) and publishes results via a Quarto dashboard. The workflow uses GitHub Actions for continuous deployment, promoting open science and educational value.
